Meetings will determine design decisions.
Small design decisions which do not impact other team members *should be* agreed upon by the designer and one other for sanity check.
Disagreements about design decisions will be timeboxed to 2 minutes and then decided by a vote.

Code *should be* reviewed by atleast two other people before merged.
Code will be merged by the author upon approval.
Code should use sonarlint for style checks. Exceptions should be documented in the code review.
Code should use unit tests in complex scenarios.
