# Expectations:
- Text/Email Responsive
- Everyone does the same work
- Be proactive
- Meet if necessary (2 hr)
- Try something once

## Design guidelines
- Meetings will determine design decisions.
- Small design decisions which do not impact other team members *should be* agreed upon by the developer and one other for sanity check.
- Disagreements about design decisions will be timeboxed and then decided by a vote.
## Workflow
- Code must build and pass all unit tests before merging.
- Code should add new unit tests to verify correctness in complex scenarios.
- Code should use sonarlint for style checks. Exceptions should be documented in the code review.
- Code *should be* reviewed by atleast two other people before merged.
- Code will be merged by the author upon approval.
